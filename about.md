I am passionate about building elegant web solutions. I love architecting solutions from the ground-up and relish the opportunity to work on exciting, new projects. 

My personal mission statement would be to work on the latest, coolest technology whilst producing efficient and elegant code. 

I've been developing websites in ASP.NET, primarily C#, for the last 20 years. My career moved into the CMS space around 10 years ago and since then I've been working with Sitecore. 

I continually strive to develop sleek, robust and future-proof solutions and am delighted about the plethora of Sitecore products that are available to achieve this.

Outside of that I love everything music; listening, watching, playing, being... and I also like to stay fit. If that's possible when you're developer.
