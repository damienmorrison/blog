# Getting Started with HTML

In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and get you started on your journey to becoming a web developer. HTML is the foundation of every web page, and understanding its structure and syntax is essential.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language used to structure the content of a web page. It consists of a series of elements or tags that define the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These elements are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

## Setting Up Your HTML Document

To create an HTML document, start by opening a new text file in a code editor of your choice. Save the file with a .html extension, such as `index.html`. Then, begin with the following basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
